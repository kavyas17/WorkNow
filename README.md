# WorkNow
A single platform to apply to internships and have all user information saved in one place. 


When applying to internships we have to fill out a Workday application every time and make an account for each new position. This is very repetitive and makes the application process lengthy and tiresome. This could be resolved by creating a Workday platform that companies can implement in the application process that allows users to make an account ONCE. Users can upload their resume and necessary information to be stored in the Workday platform. This information can then be retrieved when users want to apply to jobs, instead of having to input it every time. This will also be company specific, so if there are specific questions that a company wants to ask, then each application can be modified to fit that.
